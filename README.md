### What I have Done

- WHEN I open the planner THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
- WHEN I scroll down THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
- WHEN I view the time blocks for that day THEN each time block is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
- WHEN I click into a time block THEN I can enter an event
- WHEN I click the save button for that time block THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
- WHEN I refresh the page THEN the saved events persist
